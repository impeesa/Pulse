You set yearly quotas for us with rebates or discounts and when we step up and over buy at the end of the year, then you get indignant when we don't make your new quota the following year.  Your competition does not do that and with your continued practice of that sales tactic, you are going to drive us to your competition."	1/7/11 11:413014	20101130	COLONY TIRE	"Cash, Lee"	10	The product that you supply is always consistant.
